## üõ†Ô∏è Networking Daily Scripts (`networking_daily_scripts/`)

### üåç **Bulk Traceroute Tool**

- **File**: `bulk traceroute/traceroute.ps1`
- **Why it bangs**:
  1. Reads hosts from `hostlist.txt` and auto-validates before firing.
  2. Dumps clean CSV reports and opens them for you.
  3. Console colors keep you in the loop like a pro gamer.

### üß≠ **NSLookup Arsenal**

1. **PowerShell Edition** (`NSLOOKUP hostname to ip/nslookup-hostnsame-ip.ps1`)
   - Bulk forward lookups with CSV output and graceful error handling.
2. **Python Squad** (`nslookup` folder)
   - `multilookup.py` for batch jobs.
   - `lookup.py` (Tkinter GUI) with clipboard magic and two-way resolution.
3. **Single-File Goodness**: Updated scripts across `nsLookup-Powershell/` and `nsLookup-Python/` keep things modular.

### üì° **Ping and Status Finder**

- **File**: `Ping and Status finder/ping only.ps1`
- **Why you'll grin**:
  - Batch ping sweep with automatic CSV reports.
  - Host list managed in `hostlist.txt` for quick edits.
  - Console colors = instant green/red dopamine hits.

## üß∞ Python Powerhouse (`python_tools/`)

### üß¨ [JSON Correlator Flask App (`python_tools/Json_Corellator/`)](python_tools/Json_Corellator)

- **Core Engine**: `corellateJson.py`
- **Why it's legendary**:
  1. Launch a full web UI with Tailwind styling.
  2. Compare, visualize, and highlight JSON matches in real time.
  3. Add/remove panes on the fly with zero reloads.
  4. Built-in validation keeps payloads honest.

### üõ°Ô∏è [Security Incident Response Report Generator (`python_tools/Security_Incident_Response_Report_generator/`)](python_tools/Security_Incident_Response_Report_generator)

- **Show Runner**: `main.py` with Flask magic.
- **Mega Features**:
  - Full NIST SP 800-61 phase coverage with dynamic tables.
  - Markdown + DOCX report export (hello, compliance!).
